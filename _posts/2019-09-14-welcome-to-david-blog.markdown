First of all, Thank you for stopping by.

# Who am I?
Hi, I am `David Merino`, a *polymath* from Costa Rica who loves to plant trees.

I was born in Cali, Colombia. It all started when I arrived at my mother´s uterus while she was in USA. I was then taken across Central America to Costa Rica and then taken by air to Colombia, where I exited my mother´s body. A few months after that I was taken back to Costa Rica to stay.

I have tremendous curiosity and I hope to be constantly producing something out of that.

#### I believe in the statement -

# What is this site about?
Starting a blog and creating an online presense, to share my learnings was always a must for me. Finally today I decided to start doing it on my own site.
I want to use this site as a place to share my experiences with interacting with this world, hoping someone will benefit from the findings.
